# Mappie

A map extractor for modern Call of Duty titles/

## Requirement
1. [.NET Desktop Runtime 9.0.3](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0)

## Libraries
1. [Cast.NET](https://github.com/Scobalula/Cast.NET)

## Questions..?
> Why are there no images?

Images exporting are disabled and will not be implemented. However ```base_mesh_images_list.txt``` and ```static_props_images_list.txt``` will contains all of the textures that you need. Simply copy everything and paste it into Greyhound search bar and export textures from there

## Tips for extracting
You are recommeded to use ```-staticpropsrange``` to limit the amount of props that will be extracted so Blender can handle them.
